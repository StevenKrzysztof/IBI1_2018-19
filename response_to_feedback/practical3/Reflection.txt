To use GitKraken, we could do version control, e.g., save versions of our codes or work, and make further improvement. 
We could also see what difference we made on each step.
To merge branches make it possible for us to work together and do peer correction.
For github, I found it difficult in "fork" and get the documents in my own GitKraken, because the internet connection did not
seem to be well, and I spent a lot of time waiting. But this is truely useful function because it allow us to see other's work
on GitHub.
