# This is your formative feedback for the IBI1 portfolio.


## Please do the following:

- [ ] On https://stevenkrzysztof.github.io/ most of the text (except in the banner) is unchanged from the template text. Modify it to make it more specific.

- [ ] Add this file to your GitHub fork of IBI1_2018-19. You are allowed to delete the last line (giving your score) before uploading the file to GitHub, if you do not want others to see it. 

- [ ] Make changes to your code from weeks 3 to 5 according to the feedback below. This will form part of your summative assessment. (You may use the checkboxes to keep track of your progress) 


## Feedback:

### Feedback Week 3:

- [ ]  The folder for Practical 3 should have a file called Reflection.txt, which contains your reflections about the practical, e.g. what went well and what you found difficult.

- [ ] Commit messages should be informative, i.e. give an indication of what changed in the latest commit. "kiki" is not a good commit message.


### Feedback Week 4:

- [ ] File variables.py should contain variables called W and Z that encode different ways of saying "either X or Y". Define those and check that they are the same, no matter the truth values of X and Y

- [ ] collatz.py  behaves as expected,  but you should include pseudocode to document what you did.

- [ ] You managed to solve the "powers of 2" problem, but I had to look among files with similar names ("powersof2" and "power of 2 final") to find the correct version. The whole beauty of using a version control system such as git is that you don't need to manually create copies of files with different names for different versions. git takes care of that. If you have several file, make sure that the correct version is in the file whose name corresponds to the specifications. Your user can not be expected to search around for the correct file.

- [ ] Pseudocode should be used to document the ideas and steps taken in the "powers of 2" exercise


### Feedback Week 5:


- [ ] The code for counting nucleotides and displaying the results is fine, but you should ask the user to input a nucleotide sequence, instead of hard-coding it in the script.

- [ ] The code for counting nucelotides counts correctly and visualises the pie chart correctly, but in between the two waits for a user input. The user does not necessarily know that. Remove the necessity of user input before displaying the pie chart, or let the user know what they are expected to do at this point.

- [ ] The code for reverse ordering words and sorting them is fine, but you should ask the user to input the string. Look up the input() function for more information
