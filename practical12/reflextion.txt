The practical was hard to do. I enjoyed on doing mathmatical calculation on expression the susceptible and recovered people.
I also got to know how to select a random people and express area infection in python.
I learnt many plotting skills and think how things could be different when minus number exists.
The most important thing I learnt is to use array and plot to express infection in population. ( And from my classmate's code
I saw how can we make gif by python).
